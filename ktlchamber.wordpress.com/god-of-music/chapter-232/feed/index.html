I think white is like a catchy pop song that does great inside home market, Silver would be something that starts to break into foreign markets and gold is something that will do well globally. MJs music seems to be the standard for gold in the novel so he wants to end up with world class groups and individuals. Richard has been more of a challenge since he actually made things more difficult for KangYoon, and we still have 100 chapters left so we may see more of him.]]></description>

For sure tho, I&#039;m also curious about World&#039;s standard in that aspect. While there&#039;s a few mention in the past chapter about world=skills, there&#039;s close to none regarding the comparison between the past standard and the bare minimum of silver for now. 

I hope there will be a few mention about wheter the standard getting higher because of the competitions, or World being exceptional in that regard or maybe tthis is just plot hole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is getting tiring... All staffs on MC side are capable, moral, and loyal. Never an internal problem. Not even talent or resource shortage due to being small company. Oppositions are evil and stupid. I had hoped Richard will offer a &#039;capable&#039; opposition, but nothing so far... 

And the bar is weirdly raised. From white being a successful song to a silver minimum now. While it meant to show &#039;progress&#039;, it raises the question why MC and EDDIOS were successful back when they were producing just white.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m guessing MG will start receiving lawsuit regarding black environment soon. 

Oh well, restricting employee, not allowing artist to make songs, piling up debts. MG power&#039;s sure is getting weaker huh. 

That Richard will also start to take MG and maybe there&#039;ll scavanger battle to take MG between World and that company Richard&#039;s from. 

Thanks for the new chapter~!]]></description>
