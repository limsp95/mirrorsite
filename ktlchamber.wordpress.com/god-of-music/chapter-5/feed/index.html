Nope, it&#039;s clear that he was pretty unlucky in his previous life (being assigned to people with not-so-good ability and character). Also, his position was different than it is in his current life (he was not in a commanding position like now), so his failure didn&#039;t have that much to do with &#039;skills&#039;. He would just have failed and succeeded from time to time, like it happens normally to most people who work hard, if not for his bad luck. Also, we&#039;re being shown how the &#039;ability&#039; works (and the MC is also learning about it) at this point, so it&#039;s obvious that the emphasis would be placed on the &#039;light&#039;, not on his skills.

You need to be a open-minded person, if you really want to succeed in various aspects of life. Hope you grow up and become mature enough to judge things better than you do now.]]></description>
