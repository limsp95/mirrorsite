					<description><![CDATA[“…Just the necessary stuff was enough to fill 3 bags?” (T/N: And she was stingy with spending money… or is it different? Female readers, what’s your answer?)
It depends on the bag size tbh, so for me personally I like to have cloths to relax in (generally sweats or just loose clothing I wouldn&#039;t wear in public), then day cloths(aka casual wear for out in public), if we&#039;re going out somewhere  higher class then something for that as well. Pajamas are needed as well because it&#039;s a foreign place I don&#039;t know and wouldn&#039;t be comfortable sleeping naked. (can&#039;t plan on using the relaxing set in case they get dirty I wouldn&#039;t want to sleep in them)They&#039;re going to the beach so at least one bathing suit depends on where it is and such. Generally I would take all that then add 1-2 more sets of each excluding the bathing suit as insurance that I had clean cloths / something for the occasion. 10 hats though, not so much.

Just how much stuff do women need… KangYoon was dumbfounded. The only thing KangYoon had was a single backpack. Three sets of clothes, three pairs of underwear. Skin lotion and such basic cosmetics and medical products. That was it.

Now imo, this is rough for a &quot;vacation&quot; you&#039;re not supposed to worry much and just relax, which she can&#039;t do. Because she&#039;s on a beach... with three pairs of clothing. Get wet once and she&#039;s done. She&#039;s also going to have to sleep in her underwear or naked in a strange house (which sucks) then reuse that underwear if she doesn&#039;t launder it herself (which is what I would do in that situation)]]></description>
