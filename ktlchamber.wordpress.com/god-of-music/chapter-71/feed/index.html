If you really pay attention to his thoughts and actions so far, it&#039;s clear that he is SO much better than those so-called &#039;dense male protagonist&#039;; you just need to pay attention to details to see the huge difference.

Those male protagonists are &#039;dense&#039; for little to no reason, but here, KangYoon has several big and totally logical and and understandable reasons to not pay attention to &#039;romance&#039; with these girls. You&#039;re being too narrow-minded and biased by placing him under the same category as those useless and trashy protagonists. Do NOT always see things from the perspective of the girls; you need to consider the Mc&#039;s position as well to be able to make a decent judgement. In short, Grow Up and be Mature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s it. I give up. I can&#039;t take it anymore. Sorry, but I will drop this series. Minseo is too icky. I am terribly disturbed by her behavior and attitude and the fact that she is still a teen. With the way the story progressing, I bet kangyoon will end up with her, which I terribly hate. This novel has a potential but the romance ruin everything. Tbh I am surprises that so many people like her character and even said she is cute.. *puke* hell.. the world is surely strange.]]></description>
