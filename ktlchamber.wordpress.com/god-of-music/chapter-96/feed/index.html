I agree.
Before I said something only on WM vs Yerang pov to make it simple. So it&#039;s either WM or Yerang who&#039;d have the upper hand in Yerang&#039;s scheming. But of course it won&#039;t be that simple. Like you said, the band would be the one to take the most hit since Yerang used them to attack WM.

If Lee ChaHee agree to Yerang, she would be ungrateful to HyunAh who rejected Yerang for the sake of the band. In fact, shouldn&#039;t she be suspicious instead? Because Yerang&#039;s action to scout her after rejecting the band before is quite questionable.]]></description>

Who will really loss alot will be Lee ChaHee IF she stupidly accept it, I don&#039;t think KangYoon is not a saint to accept her back when she regret it and want to comeback, while their small company still need to grow then she stabbing them in the back, wow I&#039;am gonna hate that, even that KangYoon still get something for the contract, even the ones will be hurt so much is the band team, and Lee HyunAh, the bassist probably will gonna took a blow in reputation with fans, which will not very good at all, clearly Yerang will just dump her after they succeed. Hopefully she&#039;s not that stupid just for a moment of popularity. Actually in the long term when the band got famous, eventually every member will have fans each, like how many famous band in reality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm interesting..
Yerang wanted to sow discord on the band. Unfortunately, the band is not the only bread-winner of WM anymore. Even if the plan succeed KY should still be able to get something from breach of contract, he then can consider for HyunAh to go solo or just get another bassist. It would be a setback but should not be a big problem.

Also I think Yerang is the one losing because grooming a bassist is a lot less profitable than a singer. it&#039;s also a lot harder to make her famous.

We should see what Yerang would do next..]]></description>
