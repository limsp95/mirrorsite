The fact that he reincarnated is something unnatural already... Let&#039;s just say that this was the effect of his accumulated experiences as 7 years manager, 10 minus + 1 midas years planner, 3 years in america and etc. (main character halo, reincarnated...) I also think that his ability to see music has improve his sensitivity. With all these reasons, being &#039;this&#039; perceptive is quite natural.]]></description>

I think it&#039;s not as simple as &#039;pacifying everyone at the right time&#039;. You might see it that way as a reader, but to him (KangYoon) who has been thinking about all the things that the company and its members might be facing, it was not really unnatural for him to be intentionally providing the opportunity to calm things down with the band members. For example, it&#039;s obvious to anyone with a working brain that the band members would feel insecure given the situation, so him dealing with them at this point was completely natural. The same goes for Hyunah&#039;s case, as it was nothing difficult to realize that she would feel left out due to the decision made.

It would only feel odd, if such a thing happened later in the story, when there&#039;s no clear sign of unrest among the members. But when things are so obvious for any smart person, dealing with such things at the early phase is only natural. The thing is, that the opponents acted as soon as the band made its appearance, so the time simply coincided with when KangYoon was going to deal with the issue anyway. 
Hope now you can see how wrong you were to see the whole thing as &#039;a bit of a stretch&#039;, when it was pretty natural.]]></description>
