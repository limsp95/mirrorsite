<p>We will also be picking up and finishing Arena! I know some of you out there are long time readers of that novel, I included, so im quite happy to finish it up and give it a proper ending.</p>
<p>Now for our final project! We will be picking up a novel that those of you in the discord might know about,</p>
<div class="seriestitlenu">I Studied Mainly Textbooks!</p>

<div></div>
<div>We previously did a couple chapters of this novel so it will be nice to finish it off as well.</div>

					<description><![CDATA[TL;DR &#8211; Chamber going to military = no more translations Hey everyone, Chamber here. As some of you may know, I&#8217;ve been TRYING(lol) to go to the military for what, the past 10 months or so, and I&#8217;m FINALLY GOING. This is also the reason I&#8217;ve not doing actively sponsored chapters, or patreon, like everyone &#8230; <a href="https://ktlchamber.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/the-future-of-chambers-translations/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The future of Chamber&#8217;s&#160;translations</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR &#8211; Chamber going to military = no more translations</strong></p>
<p>Hey everyone, Chamber here.</p>
<p>As some of you may know, I&#8217;ve been TRYING(lol) to go to the military for what, the past 10 months or so, and I&#8217;m FINALLY GOING. This is also the reason I&#8217;ve not doing actively sponsored chapters, or patreon, like everyone was telling me to.<span id="more-1336"></span></p>
<p>Date: July 9th, 2018.<br />
Duration: 21 months.</p>
<p>That is 19 days from today. What this means is that God of Music, One Man Army, and Possessing Nothing will no longer be translated.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m here to talk about my &#8216;policies&#8217;, (Is that the right word?) regarding my translations.</p>
<p>Okay, first up, I&#8217;m not sure if wordpress will keep my website running (it&#8217;s a free wordpress.com website, so I don&#8217;t pay for anything). So, just in case everything goes down, I&#8217;m going to make my google drive folders for all 3 series open. These will go public around the <strong>5th of July</strong>, give or take.</p>
<p>(Wait, wasn&#8217;t there something like NU archiving no-longer available chapters or smth&#8230;? I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;)</p>
<p>The fact that I will disclose the files also means that I&#8217;ll allow anyone to post those chapters to their own site <strong>UNDER THE CONDITION THAT YOU&#8217;LL CONTINUE TRANSLATING THE SERIES</strong>. If you don&#8217;t plan to translate it, don&#8217;t bother. (I&#8217;m pretty sure that excludes aggregator sites, right.). Also, I would like some credit for those chapters as well&#8230; lol.</p>
<p>If you wish to continue translating for <strong>THIS</strong> website, then uh&#8230; I guess you can either: 1. contact me through e-mail. or 2. if I&#8217;m already gone, you can have the editors (IllidanStormrage, Yowamushi, and Salante) upload it for you. You can find them on my discord server.</p>
<p>FAQ (made up)</p>
<p>Q. What will you do if no one picks up your series?<br />
A. Idunno&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll pick them up once I get back.</p>
<p>Q. What will happen to the discord server?<br />
A. Hopefully, it&#8217;ll keep running&#8230; I&#8217;ll make one role with all the administrator privileges (just not server owner), probably illidan. But then, a server with no updates means a dead server. It shouldn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Q. Can we still donate to you?<br />
A. (Shamelessly) well&#8230; if you want to help me out&#8230; then sure. Why not.</p>
<p>Q. What will you do after you get back from military service?<br />
A. Study&#8230; Translating made me get my priorities backwards. I&#8217;ve probably forgotten everything I learned at college once I get back&#8230;. As for translations&#8230; I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>
<p>Q. What branch of military (navy, air force, etc) are you going to?<br />
A. Army.</p>
<p>Q. Will you die there?<br />
A. Probably.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions, ask below, or in discord, and I&#8217;ll try to answer as many as possible.</p>
